        q: 'What is Wardrobecare?',
        a: "A Lagos-based menswear and personal styling business built around one idea: dressing well shouldn't require guesswork. We pair a curated retail edit with real styling expertise — from full wardrobe consultations to shopping done entirely on your behalf.",
      },
      {
        q: 'What makes Wardrobecare different?',
        a: "Most clothing shops stop at checkout — we start there. Every service is built around answering a real question first: what actually fits you, what works together, what's worth buying. The clothes follow from that, not the other way round.",
      },
      {
        q: 'Who is Wardrobecare for?',
        a: "Any man who wants to look put-together without spending hours figuring out how — whether that's for the office, church, a wedding, or an ordinary Tuesday.",
      },
      {
        q: 'Do I need to visit a store in person?',
        a: 'Not necessarily. A large part of how we work happens over WhatsApp and video call, so you can be styled and shop without ever walking into a physical space.',

      },
      {
        q: 'Can I buy a complete outfit, not just single pieces?',
        a: 'Either way works. Buy individual items on your own, or hand the brief to Personal Shopping and let us put a full look together for you.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Can you help me decide what to buy?',

      },

        q: 'Do you have different price levels?',

      },
      {
        q: 'Can this help me figure out my personal style?',
        a: "Yes — that's the core of it. We identify the colours, cuts, and combinations that genuinely work for you, so you're not relying on trial and error.",
      },
      {
        q: 'Will you go through my existing wardrobe?',
        a: "Yes. We sort what's working from what isn't, and flag the specific gaps worth filling next.",

        q: 'What is Personal Shopping?',
        a: "We shop on your behalf — sourcing pieces based on your brief, your size, your budget, and the occasion — so you don't have to. You choose how the fitting happens: delivered to you, or a stylist brings it in person.",
      },
      {
        q: "What's the difference between Delivered and In-Person Fitting?",
        a: 'Delivered means the sourced pieces ship to you and you try them on yourself. In-Person Fitting means a stylist brings the same curated selection to your home or office and guides the try-on directly — useful if you\'d rather have someone there to help decide.',
      },
      {
        q: 'How long does an In-Person Fitting last?',

      },
      {
        q: "I genuinely don't know what to wear. Can you help?",

      },
      {
        q: "I don't have time to shop. Can you do it for me?",

      },
      {
        q: 'Can you help me build out my wardrobe?',
        a: "Yes. We look for what's genuinely missing and recommend pieces that work with what you already own, rather than just adding more.",
      },
      {
        q: 'Does packaging cost extra for a large order?',
        a: "No — items are delivered in Wardrobecare's custom shopping bags at no extra cost, however large the order. The box-tier pricing you'll see on Outfit Gifting doesn't apply here.",

        q: 'How do I book an In-Person Fitting?',

        q: 'Can I reschedule an In-Person Fitting?',

      {
        q: 'Is the Service & Handling fee optional?',
