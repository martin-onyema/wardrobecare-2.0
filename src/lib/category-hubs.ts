/**
 * Category hub pages — the dedicated landing pages behind the four main
 * retail nav items (Clothing / Footwear / Accessories / Fragrance & Grooming).
 *
 * Clicking a top-level nav label lands here instead of the all-products shop
 * grid: each hub organises its subcategories into their own editorial
 * sections (mirroring the mega-menu groups 1:1), with a product rail per
 * subcategory. Deep links still point at /shop?category=<slug> for the full
 * filtered grid, so the hub is a wayfinding + SEO layer, never a duplicate
 * of the shop page.
 *
 * `groups` intentionally mirror nav-data.ts mega groups. Sub slugs must match
 * the Prisma Category tree; subs missing from the DB are skipped gracefully.
